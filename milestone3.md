Our first screen, our home page is different than the first screen in our paper prototype because we took out having a login screen. It isn't required and we feel like our app would be simpler without a login screen. It is similar to the second page of the paper prototype, except the emoji pictures. We have the emoji hashtag names as a placeholder, and will be adding pictures later. Our Trending section at the bottom does not have a arrow to pull up or down because we want to have that section fixed, so users can scroll up or down to see more emojis. We also took out the hamburger button at the top left to fit that into a separate page, which is the history page. We feel the history page containing all the locations on the map associated with its emoji is a lot of data, so we want to display it on a separate page. To get to that page, we put the history button at the top right. We took out the top right button from the paper prototype to filter out personal markers and other people's markers on the map because after doing research on it, we don't think we can implement that. The marker on the map we have right now, when clicked on it, will display the emoji name and a number next to it. This is different than the paper prototype because we haven't figured out how to display a upvote or downvote button on the pop up display when clicking on a marker. As well, the number next to the emoji name on the display for the marker shows how many times that location has been marked with that emoji.
