For this milestone, we updated the user interface and functionality of our web app. Our home page now displays differet types of emojis that the user can select and mark up on the map. Compared to before, our map now povideds improved visual feedback, due to user's having the freedom to select their emoji of choice. Our second major feature is the abilty to filter out emojis on the map, incase the user is interested in locations corresponding to certain emojis. Compared to our previous milestone, the filtering tab now includes the emojis themselves instead of plain text. We also decided to git rid of the "Street View" page, simply because the image being produced from the street was not clear enough for the user to understand details of the searched location. Now the history page is named, "Coordinate History", that simply displays the longitudinal and latitude coordinates of all locations marked up with emojis. Therefore, the home page is more interactive and vsiaully focused, while the Coordinate page is centered around user input data.
