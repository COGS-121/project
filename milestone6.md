For this milestone we improved the user interface and functionality of our mobile web app. A user is now greeted with an introduction or tutorial to our mobile web app when they first open up the app. This introduction helps explain what the user can do with our interactive map. You can also see that we styled and branded our app more. We added a button for a user to delete the most recent marked emoji location on the map in case they accidentally mark a location while scrolling the map. Our coordinate history page improved since this time it now includes and displays the emoji that was marked at a particular location on the map.

For our data visualization, we had an option for users to turn the emojis on or off to better see the heatmap. The heatmap is our main data visualization because it will show areas on the map that are the most popular. If people mark emojis on the map near the same area, that area will appear more red. The screenshot below shows the heatmap with different areas appearing red because people marked emojis at different locations on the map.
