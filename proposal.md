Proposals: 
- Interactive markup map 
  Maybe a map of the UCSD campus, and students can input markups of spots on campus where it is bad to skateboard, crowded       spots that are bad for bicycling, quiet areas for relaxing, etc.
  
- Personal time tracker 
  This would help keep track of your different activities done throughout the day. You would use to it time the activity you     are doing, and at the end of the day there is an analyze option for viewing. It would have some type of visualization         showing the different activities you did and how much time you spent doing them. This would then suggest recommendations,     for example, a person spending too much time playing video games would be notified to reduce the amount of time playing.
 
- Price matching/comparison 
  Displaying the price of the products from different supermarkets. It lets user to find out which store(either online or in     real store) has the best price. It also has the “weekly ed” / promotion information. This app is mainly contains information   of the retailers rather than online promotions. 
  
- Water intake tracker
  This app would help individuals keep track of how much water they are drinking a day, to better be knowledgeable of whether   he or she is meeting the daily recommended water intake (8 glasses). With the help of visuals and quantitative input, the     user would be able to view how close or far away they are in achieving personal or standard water consumptions goals. To       help keep users engaged, notifications would be sent reminding one to record how much water they drank, or if they are         drinking too much. Furthermore, the app would allow one to compare their progress and results with friends and family, to     encourage participation.
